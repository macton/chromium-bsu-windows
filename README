--- CHANGES IN PROGRESS --
[x] Remove variations of image load (no processing at load time.)
[x] Remove old build system (no value in maintaining this while doing a bunch of surgery.)
[x] Image atlas (there's no reason this game needs more than one texture.)
[ ] Revise all the effects.
[ ] Don't rebind atlas texture every sprite call
[ ] WriteBuffer per feature
[x] Save and build wave data
[ ] Variations for draw backend: GL, ncurses

[ ] Reduce interface: Audio
[ ] Reduce interface: Font
[ ] Reduce interface: Platform
[ ] ...
[ ] Add new build system (cmake? tundra?)

Other notes:
- Looking at approx grid size based on vel, size
- See: HeroAmmo::checkForHits -> EnemyAircraft::checkHit (HeroAmmo size?)
- age + pos (which would you rather have for free? age+age or age+pos)
